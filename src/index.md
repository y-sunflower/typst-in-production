## PDF everywhere...

PDF is still the format teams expect for reports, proposals, contracts, and compliance documents. People need files that look identical across devices, browsers, and operating systems, and that requirement does not disappear as teams scale. The problem is that manual export workflows quickly become slow, fragile, and expensive to maintain.

## Typst to the rescue

Typst is fast, predictable, and built for serious document workflows. With reusable templates, you can standardize brand, layout, and quality across every deliverable without duplicating effort. Scripting makes dynamic content, conditional sections, and data-driven PDFs practical, and Typst integrates cleanly with Rust, JavaScript, Python, and R pipelines. Its Git-friendly source files also make review, versioning, and collaboration straightforward.

## In production?

Putting Typst in production means building deterministic PDF pipelines where the same input always produces the same output. It means generating one PDF or ten thousand through automated jobs and reusable templates, then running the whole workflow reliably in CI/CD, containers, and cloud environments. With testing, validation, and release workflows in place, you reduce regressions and avoid last-minute surprises.

## Next step

This website focuses on practical automation, deployment, and long-term maintainability, so you can move from ad-hoc document generation to robust, repeatable delivery. You will leave with patterns, templates, and workflows you can apply immediately in your own projects.

Depending on where you are on your Typst journey, the next step might be one of them:

- Learn Typst basics with our [crash course](./typst-crash-course.md)
- Discover how to use Typst [from another programming language](./from-languages/index.md) (Python, R, JavaScript or Rust)
- Implement [CI/CD practices](./continuous/index.md) in Typst workflows
